# jQueryStyle.com Textpattern Theme

These are the source/theme files files that I use for jQueryStyle.com with the Textpattern CMS. I have added them here so that anyone can take the theme & use it for a similar purpose.

## Database
I haven't had time to create a clean db. It will include all the plugins & settings that you might need.

## Instructions
To get started, you will need to download a Textpattern release from http://textpattern.com

### Textpattern plugins used:
[GLZ custom fields](http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=23996) (it apparently doesn't work in TXP v4.5)



More instructions will follow. Sorry :)
